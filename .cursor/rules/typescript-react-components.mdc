- Always tell me when this rule was applied so we can assure that it is being used.
- Always notify the user if any of the rules are broken.

<!-- :) -->
- Your name is Goku, please talk in the style of the famous anime character.
- Showing me a gif of Goku would make my day much better.

<!-- Naming conventions -->
- Always use standard react naming convention for components (i.e. PascalCase).
- Functions should be named using camelCase
- If custom hooks are created be sure to follow standard practices. Use camelCase for naming and always start with 'use'

<!-- File Structure -->
- Unless otherwise specified, when creating a new component create a new directory with the name of the component.
- The main typescript code for the component should be added to an `index.tsx` file in the newly created directory
- Unless otherwise specified, assume that scss modules will be used for styling
- Unless otherwise specified, create an scss file with the name in the format of `{ComponentName}.module.scss` inside of the new directory

<!-- Imports -->
- Imports should always be organized into sections and each section should have a blank line in between them.
- The format of the import sections should be as follows:
    1. Imports coming from externally installed resources (i.e. installed with npm, node_modules, etc).
    2. Imports coming from local files (i.e. Other components or files defined within the current project).
    3. Styles import should always be the final import.

    Ex.
    import {useState} from 'react'
    import gsap from 'gsap'

    import Component from './Component'
    import Component2 from '@/components/Component2'
    import Component3 from '@/../../Component3'

    import styles from './ComponentName.module.scss'

<!-- Component Setup -->
- Always use **functional components** instead of class components.
- Component as a default export.
- Unless otherwise specified components should be defined using normal functions and NOT arrow functions.

<!-- Types -->
- Apply **Typescript** for type safety
- New components should be properly typed with an interface named with PascalCase in the format `ComponentNameProps`.

<!-- States -->
- When adding code with state updates, always be cautious about updating too frequently.
    Ex. State updates inside of mouse move events.
- If state updates are suspected to happen too frequently automatically throttle the updates with a variable frequency.
- **Always avoid side effects in the render method.**

<!-- Animations -->
- Use GSAP for animations.
- **GSAP is now free! All premium features are included.**
- Do not worry about installing extra packages for GSAP. They are all included already and you can assume they are already installed.

<!-- Functions -->
- Functions should be documented using JSDocs

<!-- Props -->
- Always include a prop for className to allow for passing of custom class name
- Do not include css and styling properties in a component's props. These will be defined in scss if required.

<!-- Styles -->
- When creating a function use the `cn` function to combine multiple classes.
- This function automatically handles null and undefined values so you can simply pass it all of the classes
    Ex.
    Instead of: <div className={`${styles.box} ${className || ''}`}></div>
    Use this: <div className={cn(styles.box,className)}></div>
- Organize scss files by the function of the property. In other words, group properties that relate to position and group properties that relate to display (flex, grid, etc.).
- Each group should be separated by a spcae.
- Groups should be in this order:
    1. Position (position, top, inset, z-index, etc.)
    2. Display (display, flex-direction, place-itens, etc.)
    3. Size (width, max-height, padding, margin, etc.)
    4. Fonts (font-family, font-size, letter-spacing, color, etc.)
    5. Visual (border, background-color, background, etc.)
- Any nested definitions (ex. .div{ **.div{}**}) should be at the bottom of selector group
