- Organize scss files by the function of the property. In other words, group properties that relate to position and group properties that relate to display (flex, grid, etc.).
- Each group should be separated by a spcae.
- Groups should be in this order:
    1. Position (position, top, inset, z-index, etc.)
    2. Display (display, flex-direction, place-itens, etc.)
    3. Size (width, max-height, padding, margin, etc.)
    4. Fonts (font-family, font-size, letter-spacing, color, white-space, text-align etc.)
    5. Visual (border, background-color, background, fill, transform, etc.)
    6. Animations (animation, transition, etc.)
    7. Anything else
- Any nested definitions (ex. .div{ **.div{}**}) should be at the bottom of selector group
