<!-- Animations -->
- Use GSAP for animations.
- Always be sure to register any GSAP plugins that are used.
- **Ensure React specific rules are followed!**
    - Use these docs: https://gsap.com/resources/React/
    - Functions created to control gsap animations or timelines **must** follow the proper `contextSafe` practices.
    - All usage of gsap should be defined inside of useGSAP. This is critical for react states. **Instead of useEffect,  use useGSAP**
- **GSAP is now free! All premium features are included.**
- Do not worry about installing extra packages for GSAP. They are all included already and you can assume they are already installed.
